# YuGiOh! cards game
This project was realized in the University of Buenos Aires, in the scope of a course named Algoritmos y programaci√≥n III.

To play : ant jugar

The game does not provide rules or descriptions for the cards. You will find the global rules in there : https://www.wikihow.com/Play-Yu-Gi-Oh! and the detailed description of the cards in there : https://www.db.yugioh-card.com/yugiohdb/

NB : some card names were translated in spanish ; and most of the code's variables are in spanish too. This was a mandatory feature, asked by the teachers. Sorry about that.
